Just got out of the theater from watching Novocaine and I'm... well, I’m not sure if I’m buzzing or if my brain is just frazzled from trying to chew on a plot that felt like mental bubble gum. Seriously though, Steve Martin as a dentist who gets messed up in some kind of creepy crime crap — who’da thought? It’s like putting a tutu on a bulldog and calling it a ballerina. But it kinda worked, at least in a weird, offbeat way.

The movie sorta jerks you around. Crazy, like trying to do calculus when you’re hungover. I mean, parts of it were slick, like they waxed the screen or something — you fall in, get totally caught up. But then you blink and bam, it morphs into this chaotic, frenzied, overly sugar-pumped version of a thriller. Susan - or was it Helena Bonham Carter’s character? Whatever, she was like our cultural guilty pleasure: biting into a mystery candy and hoping it explodes with something exciting.

> That soundtrack! It stabbed into the film like a needle, adding these awkward pauses at just the right (or wrong?) moments. Like that awkward relative who shows up at weddings and tells the same story over and over.

By the way, can we talk about how energetic and deadpan it feels at the same time? Honestly, it left me wondering if they meant it all to be that absurdly intentional. Maybe I've just had too much coffee today, but honestly, I might just download the movie and watch the movie again with friends, just to see if all the oddity keeps rolling when I’m not two hours deep in overdosed popcorn buttery haze.

function pullOutTooth(tool) {
  return tool === 'Novocaine' ? 'Plot twist' : 'Ouch';
}
```

I still don’t know if it was genius or what my mind conjured up when it had too many gummy bears. Perhaps I walked into the wrong theater, and they just carried me with trickery and gummy dentistry because I can't stop thinking about how gloriously unhinged Novocaine truly was. Or maybe I’m just tired. Maybe it’s my mind swooning over Steve Martin’s wrinkle-adorned charm. 

All I know is my brain is buzzing like a cheap neon sign, and I'm kinda here for it.
